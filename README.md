# kitti_depthmap
Module for converting raw lidar in kitti to depthmaps in C++/Python.

## Why I wrote this
Surprisingly, I wasn't able to find any decent/simple/readable code online to figure out how to generate registered depthmaps from the kitti pointcloud data. And those that did, gave garbage results (when actually visualized as a pointcloud), or were written with for loops in python which were way too slow for a data pipeline. This codebase handles parallax errors that come from a large transformation between a sparse 3d sensor and an rgb image, and also performs resampling in spherical coordinate space, leading to more accurate results.

### To Run
```
mkdir build;
cd build;
cmake ..;
make
python3 testing.py # Change the path in the file to point to the kitti data
```
[1] OpenCV - C++ (Create build folder inside the source directory)

[2] sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev
    Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Eigen3" with any of the following names:
    Eigen3Config.cmake
    eigen3-config.cmake

[3] sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev 
    Install # include <opencv/cxeigen.hpp>

### Large Image
Accounting for parallax  distortion etc.

### Small Image
Works well for small images too

### Sampling Modes (Lower)
Selectively simulate a higher or lower resolution lidar in spherical space

### Upsampling (Higher)
Selectively simulate a higher or lower resolution lidar in spherical space
